Once upon a time, in a land where dragons **fly**, songs **sing**, and dreams **come** true, 
there **was** a boy named Theo. 
He had **been** an ordinary farm boy, but one day, he **became** a legend.

It all **began** when he **cut** a strange tree in the woods. 
The moment he **had cut** it, the sky **broke** open, and a glowing sword **fell** from the clouds. 
As soon as he **had broken** the tree and **taken** the sword, the adventure **began**.

He **put** the sword in his bag and **set** out on a quest. 
He **had put** his fears aside and **set** his heart on greatness. 
Along the way, he **hit** a goblin (who had **hit** him first!) and **shut** the door of a collapsing cave behind him. 
The cave **had shut** forever.

In a nearby village, rumors **spread** of a boy who had **spread** hope. 
The villagers **brought** him gifts and **bought** him meals. 
He **had brought** them joy and **had bought** nothing in return.

But danger **caught** up with him. 
A dark knight **fought** him on a bridge. 
They **had fought** fiercely until Theo **won**. 
He **had won** more than a fight—he **found** courage.

A wise old woman **taught** him spells. 
She **had taught** many, but Theo was her best student. 
He **learned** to fly, **grew** wings, and **flew** across mountains. 
He **rode** a phoenix, **had ridden** dragons, and **driven** away shadows that **had driven** fear into hearts.

He once **dreamed** of glory. 
Now he **dreamt** of peace. 
But the dark wizard who **led** the evil army **had led** a curse into the land. 
Theo **sought** him. He **had sought** justice.

Theo **felt** fear when he **saw** the wizard. 
He **had felt** it before—but this time, he **knew** he could win. 
The wizard **threw** fireballs. 
Theo **threw** lightning. A blast **tore** the ground. 
It **had torn** the sky.

“I **swear** I’ll stop you!” Theo **swore**.

“I’ve **worn** darkness for centuries!” the wizard **said**, as he **stood** tall. 
“You **cannot** stop what I’ve **become**.”

But Theo **had worn** hope like armor. 
He **spoke**, “I **understand** your pain.”

That moment **broke** the spell. 
The wizard **wept**. 
He **had been** a hero once too.

Theo **left** quietly. 
He **had left** peace behind. 
He **kept** his sword but **never used** it again.

Years later, children **heard** the story. 
Their teachers **told** them, “He **built** a home in the hills and **grew** tomatoes.”

They **laughed**, “The hero who **ran**, **ate**, and **slept** like us?”

Yes. He **ran** for fun now. 
He **ate** apples. 
He **slept** in hammocks. 
He **had grown** tired of fighting. But he **never lost** hope.

He **sat** often by the lake, **drew** birds in a notebook, 
and **wrote** poems about stars that **shone** over silent waters.

He **read** books. 
He **had read** a thousand tales. 
He **made** tea, **paid** visits to old friends,
and **sent** letters to the king.

Sometimes, he **caught** fish. 
Sometimes, he **burned** dinner. 
Once, he **lied** in the sun so long, he **felt** crispy.

He **had lied** about nothing in life. 
His tale was true.

He **had had** it all—glory, pain, peace.

When he finally **died**, his legend **was written** in books.

And thus, a boy who once **cut**, **fought**, and **flew** became the story every child **reads**, every bard **sings**,
and every heart **remembers**.
