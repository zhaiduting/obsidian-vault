One sunny morning, Alex **cut** a piece of bread and **put** some jam on it. He **read** the newspaper, then **set** his backpack near the door. Before leaving, he **shut** the window and **spread** a map on the table.

“This trip will **cost** a lot, but it’s worth it!” he **said** to himself. He had planned everything carefully, yet he **felt** a bit nervous. Last year, a similar trip **hurt** his budget badly. However, he wouldn’t **quit**—he always **kept** his promises.

His friend Sam **brought** him a coffee and **bought** some snacks. “If you ever **lose** your way, just call me,” Sam **told** him.

Alex **left** home early and **caught** a bus to the airport. There, he **met** a traveler who had **fought** hard to get a ticket.

On the plane, Alex **thought** about the journey ahead. He had always wanted to **seek** adventure, so this trip **meant** a lot to him.

Once he **landed**, he **found** a local guide who **taught** him how to navigate the mountains. The sun **shone** brightly as they **began** their climb. The guide **led** the way while Alex **held** onto a rope carefully.

At sunset, they **sat** by the fire and **sang** songs. Alex **drank** some tea while the guide **told** stories of past travelers.

Suddenly, a loud bell **rang**—it was a warning from another camp. They rushed to help and **swam** across a river.

The next day, Alex **wrote** about his adventure and **drew** a map to mark the places he had explored. He **chose** to **ride** a horse instead of walking, but the animal almost **threw** him off!

During the trip, he **ate** exotic food and **spoke** with locals who **knew** fascinating traditions. He even **saw** a festival where people **wore** colorful costumes and **flew** giant kites.

After weeks of travel, Alex **understood** that adventure wasn’t just about the destination—it was about the people he **met**, the challenges he **overcame**, and the memories he had **made**.

When he finally **came** home, he **stood** proudly and **swore** he would never forget this trip. It had changed him—he had **become** a true explorer.
