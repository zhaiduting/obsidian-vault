### 补充说明

以下内容由[豆包](https://www.doubao.com/)提供

#### **记忆技巧**：

- AAA 型动词多为短动词（如 cut/hit），可通过 “简单动作不变形” 联想记忆；
- ABB 型中，“ought/ought”“aught/aught” 为常见组合（如 bring-brought，catch-caught）；
- ABC 型需重点区分过去式与过去分词（如 begin-began-begun，注意词尾 “n” 的添加）。

#### **拓展学习**：

不规则动词中还有少数特殊类型（如 can-could、shall-should），可结合具体语境强化记忆。建议通过造句（如 “I have eaten breakfast”）加深对时态的理解。
