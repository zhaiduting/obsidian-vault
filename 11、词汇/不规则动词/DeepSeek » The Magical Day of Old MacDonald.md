Old MacDonaldÂ **was**Â (be) a farmer whoÂ **had**Â (have) a wild imagination. One morning, heÂ **began**Â (begin) his day byÂ **drinking**Â (drink) coffee when his phoneÂ **rang**Â (ring). ItÂ **was**Â (be) his neighbor, whoÂ **said**Â (say), "Your sheepÂ **have**Â (have)Â **run**Â (run) away!"

MacDonaldÂ **sprang**Â (spring) into action. HeÂ **rode**Â (ride) his horse,Â **drove**Â (drive) his tractor, andÂ **ran**Â (run) through the fields. HeÂ **saw**Â (see) his sheepÂ **eating**Â (eat) flowers, so heÂ **caught**Â (catch) them andÂ **brought**Â (bring) them back.

Later, heÂ **found**Â (find) his dogÂ **digging**Â (dig). The dogÂ **had**Â (have)Â **dug**Â (dig) up a treasure map! MacDonaldÂ **took**Â (take) it,Â **drew**Â (draw) a route, andÂ **set**Â (set) off. HeÂ **swam**Â (swim) across a river,Â **flew**Â (fly) over a hill, andÂ **fell**Â (fall) into a bush. But heÂ **kept**Â (keep) going.

At sunset, heÂ **met**Â (meet) a wizard whoÂ **taught**Â (teach) him a spell. MacDonaldÂ **spoke**Â (speak) the words, and suddenly, gold coinsÂ **rose**Â (rise) from the ground! HeÂ **put**Â (put) them in a bag andÂ **sent**Â (send) some to his family.

That night, heÂ **dreamt**Â (dream) of dragons. HeÂ **fought**Â (fight) one,Â **hit**Â (hit) it with a stick, andÂ **cut**Â (cut) its tail. The dragonÂ **hurt**Â (hurt) his arm, but heÂ **shut**Â (shut) his eyes andÂ **woke**Â (wake) up.

The next day, heÂ **sold**Â (sell) some treasure andÂ **bought**Â (buy) a new hat. His wifeÂ **made**Â (make) pie, whichÂ **cost**Â (cost) him nothing because sheÂ **forgave**Â (forgive) his silly adventures.

At dinner, his childrenÂ **sang**Â (sing),Â **told**Â (tell) jokes, andÂ **ate**Â (eat) happily. MacDonaldÂ **felt**Â (feel) lucky. HeÂ **knew**Â (know) life wasnâ€™t perfectâ€”sometimes heÂ **lost**Â (lose) things,Â **forgot**Â (forget) chores, orÂ **broke**Â (break) tools. But heÂ **meant**Â (mean) to enjoy every moment.

As starsÂ **shone**Â (shine), heÂ **sat**Â (sit) outside,Â **thought**Â (think) about his day, andÂ **wrote**Â (write) in his journal: "Today, IÂ **became**Â (become) a treasure hunter!" Then heÂ **went**Â (go) to bed,Â **slept**Â (sleep) deeply, andÂ **dreamt**Â (dream) againâ€”this time of flying sheep.

**The End.**
