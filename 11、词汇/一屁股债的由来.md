很多老赖借钱不还，债主没办法，为了讨债只能追着老赖到处跑。这种情况在老赖眼里就是：屁股后面总是有个怎么甩也甩不掉的人，除非还清债务。于是“债务”就跟“老赖的屁股”挂钩了，这就有了”一屁股债“的说法。

Many deadbeats don't pay back the money they borrowed, and the creditors have no choice but to chase them around to collect the debts. In the eyes of the deadbeats, there is always someone behind them who can't be shaken off unless the debt is paid off. So "debt" is linked to "the deadbeat's butt", which is why there is a saying "a butt full of debts".
